# Kotlin
simplistic Stack on Kotlin


Documentation for inheritence.kt
The file is a simplistic use of interface and inheritance of the kotlin programming language
The file is divided into 2 parts: The interface implementation of Shape and two classes; Triangle and Square which 
inherits from the shape class.

                                  Shape: Interface
                                  
Properties:
    side : Int
 Â   name : String
    
Public Methods:
    getSide() : Int
    /*
        getSide: This returns an int which is the sides of the shape
        precondition: must be inherited by the class and serves as a method the object of the class
        Postcondition: NONE

    getNameOfShape() :String
    /*
        getNameOfShape: returns the name of the shape

        Postcondition: NONE

    area() : Int
    /*
        area: This returns an int which is the area of the shape.

                                    Triangle: Class
 Description:
          This class has the implementation of the Trangle class.
          The class inherits the interface Shape 
          
          
          
          
                                    Square: Class
Description:
        This class has the implementation of the triangle class
        This class also inherits the interface Square.
